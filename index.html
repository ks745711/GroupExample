        <h2>Joe Burrow is the GOAT</h2>

        <div id="hero"><img src="img/joe-burrow-becomes-emotional-in-heisman-speech.jpg" alt="Joe Burrow giving his Heisman acceptance speech."></div>

        <div class="body">

            <p>Joe Burrow is the bro. What a dude. Joe Burrow, quarterback of the Louisiana State University Tigers, is already a hero to many of us here in Ohio, where he was raised and where he started his football career. But earlier this month, Burrow received the kind of national attention even our best college athletes rarely get when he won the Heisman Trophy and used his acceptance speech to call attention to a phenomenon that deserves much wider coverage: food insecurity.</p>

            <p class="quote">"Coming from southeast Ohio, it's a very impoverished area and the poverty rate is almost two times the national average. There's so many people there that don't have a lot, and I'm up here for all those kids in Athens and Athens County that go home to not a lot of food on the table, hungry after school. You guys can be up here, too."</p>

            <p id="emphasis">Joe Burrow has made a huge impact on the Athens community over the last few weeks with over $500,000 in donations.</p>

            <p>Athens County has porued out with gratitude in the last few weeks and Joe Burrow has been referred to as a hero, with banners thanking him all over town. Joe Burrow is the hero Athens deserves and needs right now. </p>
